<- Vector ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Vector class allow you to place vertex (using required Vertex Class).

An instance can be constructed from distinct orig and dest values:
new Vector([
	'orig' => $vtxO,
	'dest' => $vtxX
]);

The constant 'orig' define the origin of the vector in the plane.
The constant 'dest' containt the coordinate to target the end of the vector.
Each values are required to use the Class Vector and depend of the Vertex Class.

The class provides the following methods :

Vector	magnitude();
Return the vector length.

Vector	normalize();
Return a normalized version of the vector. If the vector already exists, return
a new copy of the vector.

Vector	add($rhs);
Return a new vector from the sum of two vectors.

Vector	sub($rhs);
Return the difference between two vectors.

Vector	opposite();
Return the opposite vector of the current one.

Vector	scalarProduct($k);
Return the multiplication of a vector and a scalar product.

Vector	dotProduct($rhs);
Return the scalar product between two vectors.

Vector	cos($rhs);
Return the cos angle between two vectors.

Vector crossProduct($rhs);
Return the cross product between two vectors.
